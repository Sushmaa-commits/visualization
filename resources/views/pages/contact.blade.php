                <h1>Feature Articles</h1>
                <p>These stories are longer in format and cover more of the individual’s personal journey. The interview
                    period is longer in nature and the questions are more involved. They often feature the individual’s
                    home, their craft ( should the have one ), and surrounding city architecture. Place, purpose, and
                    journey are quintessential to document these interviews.</p>
